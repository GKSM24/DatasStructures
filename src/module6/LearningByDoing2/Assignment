Is an array that is sorted in Ascending order a min-oriented heap? Why?
Yes it will be a min-oriented heap because to be a min-oriented heap the parent's value in the tree should be less than children value.
When they are in ascending order when we insert values into the heap then you can see it satisfies the min-oriented heap property.
