Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations, but only a few remove the maximum operations.
Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effective: heap, unordered array, ordered array?

heap would be most effective implementation as it takes O(log n) for both insertion and deletion.
In both unordered array and ordered array there is a problem with deletion as after deletion of the maximum they have to shift the elements
and also in ordered array there is this shifting procedure to be followed.
